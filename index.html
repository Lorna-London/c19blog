            <p>Freedom was abound before the world shut down in March 2020 due to Covid-19. The pandemic resulted in a series of restrictions which many people found challenging. Yet, strangely, I stumbled upon a new freedom - online.

             <p>For me, this period opened up a world of opportunity with an abundance of amazing events hosted on Zoom. I was able to join many groups and meet new people virtually and begin a new journey into the world of coding. Tech groups were hosting events online and my calendar was full each week. It was liberating and I loved it! </p>

            <p>I started reading Creating a Website - The Missing Manual and learnt the basics of HTML and CSS. Then I jumped into building some simple websites, but I was constantly getting stuck due to gaps in my knowledge and realised I needed more structure and guidance.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Courses</h3>
            <p>After doing some research I settled on The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy in 2021. I found his teaching style really engaging and funny and the structured approach helped me focus on the key topics needed in order to learn web development effectively.</p>

            <p>I have a thirst for knowledge and use multiple resources to aid my learning, ranging from books, free and paid online courses as well as Youtube videos and, of course, good old Google. In addition, I attend coding meetups, practice on Codewars and build projects.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Coding</h3>
            <p>I'm currently working on projects for my portfolio which I hope to finish soon. The next step will be to apply for internships and/or apprenticeships in order to obtain real-world experience and get my foot in the door, whilst I continue to work on my apps for deployment to the App Store.</p>
